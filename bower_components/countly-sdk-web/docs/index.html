<p>##What's Countly?
<a href="http://count.ly">Countly</a> is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, 
and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.</p>
<p>This repository includes the Countly Web SDK. For more information about this SDK, <a href="http://resources.count.ly/v1.0/docs/countly-sdk-for-web">Countly SDK for Web</a> documentation at <a href="http://resources.count.ly">Countly Resources</a>.</p>
